Generated by the run_analysis.r:
  - tidy_data.txt: output of the project generated by run_analysis.R
  
Variables Description
---------------------
Result dataset: tidy_data.txt
  - activity: data from y_train.txt and y_test.txt
  - subject: ID of subject from subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt
  - All mean and std measurements labelled with activity_labels.txt from X_text.txt and X_train.txt
  
Transformations
---------------
Output of run_analysis.r was performed by the following steps:
  - Train dataset reading
  - Test dataset reading
  - Feature and activities dataset reading
  - Datasets Merging
  - Column naming
  - Mean and std column extraction
  - Column name cleaning (remove parenthesis)
  - Add subject and activity columns to table
  - add activity labels to the merged dataset
  - aggregate and calculate the mean by subject and activity
  - save tidy dataset to file
